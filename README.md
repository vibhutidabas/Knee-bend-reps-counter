# Knee-bend-reps-counter
A robust algorithm to calculate successful rep count for knee bend exercise using Mediapipe. Added a holding timer limit of 8 sec, and included feedback logic in your code, which should be triggered only when a person fails to stay in the holding position for 8 sec. A slight inward bend is enough to start the timer (<140 deg).
